## C Development Kit

This repository contains a collection of some data structures that I use.

Currently, the repository contains data structures for:

1. ArrayList
2. Queue / LinkedList
3. Clock

#### Using

Copy the header and the source code file for the data structure you want, and `#include` the header file in your code.

#### Bugs and features

Please create an issue/pull request in case you find a bug or want me to add a feature.
